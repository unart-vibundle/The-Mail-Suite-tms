The Mail Suite (TMS):  Send, Receive and Organize Mail
                       via an Editable User Interface (EUI)
                       using VIM As the Editor
                       (on WINDOWS and on Unix)
                       (relies on perl)
____________________________________________________________
Motivation    

People who know VIM (especially those who have discovered
explorer.vim) are aware of the speed, the customized form
and, once learned, the ease of issuing commands and
processing the results of the commands while in VIM.  This
plugin, The Mail Suite (tms), exploits that power of VIM in
the domain of electronic mail: for the tasks of sending,
receiving and organizing mail.

____________________________________________________________
The Command Set (Overview) 

Since The Mail Suite builds on VIM's command set, there are
only a handful of new commands (or tasks):

   - Get emails (from a POP3 server) and save in raw (.eml) format
   - Send a buffer (even one without a file) or files as an email (via a SMTP server)
   - Index (create a ''table of contents'' for) a folder of emails
   - Open an email from the index (and then open the next or the previous email)
   - Reply, Forward or Acknowledge an email
   - Delete, Move or Copy emails

Contrast of Interfaces for Mail Clients 

Here's a contrast that makes an aspect of the power of VIM
as a user interface clear:  other email clients need lots
more commands than the mail-specific commands listed above
since they need to provide a user interface;  and their
interface is restrictive (compared to that of VIM) in regard
to the means for navigating and manipulating the stuff on
the screen and in not allowing keystroke customization.
